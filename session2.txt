1.SDLC:
=======
            In software engineering, a software development methodology (also known as a system development methodology, software development life cycle, software development process, 
software process) is a splitting of software development work into distinct phases (or stages) containing activities with the intent of better planning and management.

2.a.SharePOint:
============
SharePoint is a web based application that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management
 and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially between organizations.
2.b.Confluence:
============
Confluence is team collaboration software. Written in Java and mainly used in corporate environments,
 it is developed and marketed by Atlassian. Confluence is sold as either on-premises software or as a software as a service.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3.Code Review Tools:
=================
a.GERRIT:
=======
Gerrit is a free, web-based team code collaboration tool. Software developers in a team can review each other's modifications on their source code using a Web browser and approve or 
reject those changes. 
It integrates closely with Git, a distributed version control system.

Gerrit is a fork of Rietveld, another code review tool. "Gerrit" is the given name of Gerrit Rietveld (1888–1964), a Dutch designer after whom Rietveld is named.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



4.Unit Testing:
===========
a.JUNIT:
======
JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development,
 and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit, that originated with JUnit.

b.TestNG:
========
TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language created by Cédric Beust and inspired by JUnit and NUnit. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test
 categories: unit, functional,
 end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5.Build Systems:
=============

a.JENKINS:
========
Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java. The project was forked from Hudson after a dispute with Oracle. Jenkins provides continuous integration services for 
software development. 
It is a server-based system running in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

b.HUDSON:
=========
Hudson is a continuous integration (CI) tool written in Java, which runs in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat or the GlassFish application server. It supports SCM tools including CVS, 
Subversion, Git, 
Perforce, Clearcase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven based projects, as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



6.BUG SYSTEM:
============
A bug tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue 
tracking system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



7.Programming paradigm:
====================
A programming paradigm is a style or “way” of programming. Some languages make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



8.COMPILED LANGUAGE vs INTEGRATED LANGUAGE:
===========================================

    Interpreted language is executed at the run time according to the instructions like in shell scripting and compiled language is one which is 
compiled (changed into Assembly language, which CPU can understand ) and then executed like in c++.

                                                                                                                  RESTful WebServices 
                                                                                                 ================================
01.INTRODUCTION:
================
The term REST was introduced by ROY FIELDING. REST is expanded as REpresentational State Transfer.It is an architectural style. There are no rules,protocol standard ,communication channel 
standard,
service definition and no specifications.REST does notneed of any documentation but it has WADL ,but it is not used  by most of the users.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


02.REST and HTTP:
===============
HTTP:
=====
HyperText TransferProtocol,used to exchange and communicate information online . This information is known as hypertext. The logical links are known as hyperlinks. REST has resources and 
addresses too.It contains metadata(extra information).It has HTTP methods commonly GET,PUT,POST,DELETE. It also contains STATUS CODES,which indicate whether the response is successful or is
there any error in it. In RESTful Web Services, we cannot send readable messages because client is a piece of code, so we need to send status codes.

FORMAT OF MESSAGES: 
===================
Header value called content type (metadata) specifies the format of the messages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



03.RESOURCE URI's:
=================
There are two levels ,first level and the second level.
Resourse URIS's: 
                          The resources consists of directiories. The directories contains set of collection of files in it , which can be accessed through URI's.
BEST PRACTICES OF WRITING REST API's:
=================================
                           1.Identify the entities ,they become resources.
                           2.Assign URI's to those resources.
RESOURCE RELATION:
==================
                           The relation can be made between the resources. The format will be 
                                             /Messages/{messageid}/comments/{commentsid}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



04.COLLECTION URI's:
==================
                            There are two types of URI's: Instance and collection.
Instance URI is nothing but getting information about a single instance whereas COLLECTION URI is about getting the information about ALL the instance in the directory.
FILTERING RESULTS:
================
                       Filtering can be done using query parameter(?). Query parameter is used for pagination and for filtering collection URI's.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




05.HTTP METHODS:
================
                      The difference between normal URI and RESTful URI is that all the operations are made in the client side by using differen HTTPmethods and based on the HTTP methods
the operations will be performed.
Common HTTP Methods are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
It is applicable to collection URI's also.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



06.METHOD IDEMPOTENCE:
=======================
                        The classification can be made in two different ways.
One is by making use of read and write operations. That is, GET is READ ONLY but PUT, POST, DELETE are write operations in the server.
The second way of classification is based upon Repeatable and Non-repeatable operations.
The methods GET, PUT and DELETE can be safely repeated so it is IDEMPOTENT but POST operation cannot be safely repeated so it is NON-IDEMPOTENT.

IDEMPOTENCE:
==============
                           Idempotence is the property of certain operations in Mathematics and Computer Science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial
application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



07.REST RESPONSE :
=================
                      The response for Web Application will be in HTML(Styling should be done).
                      The response for RESTful Web Services will be in XMl/JSON.

JSON's response for the request will contain same datamember entity filled with the response values in it.
Header contains message length , data and the Content Type.

STATUS CODES:
=============
                    The very first line contains the status code followed by which have the short message description for the code.
                                    Eg. 200 OK, 404 NOT FOUND
The status codes ranges from 100 to 500. We have five classes in it ie. 1XX to 5XX.
                           1XX- Informational code/acknowledgement. 
                           2XX- Success code ie.200 OK,201 CREATED.
                           3XX- Redirection codes ie. 302 FOUND, 307 TEMPORARY REDIRECT.
                           4XX- Client Error ,ie. 400 BAD REQUEST, 404 NOT FOUND.
                           5XX- Server error, ie.500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



08.HATEOAS:
===========
                HATEOAS is a way to provide links to resources in the API response, so that the client does not have to deal with the URI construction and bussiness flow.

                 It is expanded as
                                              Hypermedia
                                              As
                                              The
                                              Engine
                                              Of
                                              Application   
                                              State
It contains hypertext and hyperlinks. We have "rel" attribute.

rel ATTRIBUTE:
============
                    rel Attribute is used to specify the relationship between the current document and the link. rel Attribute is a part of HTTP Specification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




09.THE RICHARDSON MATURITY MODEL:
==================================
                                    It was developed by LEONARD RICHARDSON.
It has three levels:                
                                    level 3
                                    level 2
                                    level 1
 
                                    level 0: it is not a RESTful API.

LEVEL 0:
========
             It contains one URI. The request body contains all the details. It is often called as SWAMP OF POX(Plain Old XML).

LEVEL 1:
========
            By refining the LEVEL 0 by adding RESOURCE URI, then we reach LEVEL 1. Individual URI's for each response.

LEVEL 2:
========
           By refining the LEVEL 1 by using different HTTP METHODS for different operations , then we reach LEVEL 2. It also uses the STATUS CODES.

LEVEL 3:
========
           Implementing HATEOAS will reach LEVEL 3. Response have links that the client can use. It is considered as FULLY RESTful API.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




10.JAX-RS:(interfaces and annotatins)
==============================
              JAX-RS contains libraries like Jersey and RESTEasy .
The library classes contains JAX-RS in it defaultly.
Just by adding it up with the application code will make a REST API Application 
JERSEY:
=======
            "Reference implementation " for the JAX-RS specification.
