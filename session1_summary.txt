Version Control System:
             Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Centralized VCS:
              Centralized VCS have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. based on the idea that there is a single central copy of your project somewhere  and programmers will commit their changes to this central copy.

Distributed VCS:
             These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every developer clones a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive.

Code Review Tools:
              Code Review Tools are the online application programs that helps us to remove the bugs in our code and thus making it a more optimized one.
